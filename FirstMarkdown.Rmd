This report documents my first attempts of using Git and GitHub to version
control an RStudio project. I will be modifying this report, staging and committing changes and then pushing to GitHub

Let's create a test plot of distance (miles) and speed (mph)

```{r, test=plot}
plot(cars, col="red", xlab= "speed (mph)", ylab = "distance (miles)")
```


A summary of the data frame is given below. 

```{r, cars-summary}
library(knitr)
kable(summary(cars))
```
